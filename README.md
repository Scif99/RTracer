An implementation of Whitted-style Ray Tracing. Uses OOP. 

Renders something like this:
![Balls](/images/Balls.jpeg?raw=true "Optional Title")

The image above took just under 40s to render, using 50 samples per pixel and a recursion depth of 10.

Conventions:
- Surface normals always point outwards.
