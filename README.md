Design
- Uses type system to enforce normalisation of vectors

TO-DO
- Replace ray-sphere quadratic with more stable version. (https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/minimal-ray-tracer-rendering-simple-shapes/ray-sphere-intersection)
- What happens with double-sided triangles?
- Current RGN singleton will use same seed every time
- Creating bounding boxes for triangles
- Cachse BoundingBox() function for primitives
